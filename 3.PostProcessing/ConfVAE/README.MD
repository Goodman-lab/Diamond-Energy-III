# Diamond Energy Projects - ML Conformer Generation

## Overview
Once trained on Diamond Energy Projectsâ€™ data, the ML models are capable of generating low-energy conformers for test molecules, which can be compared to results from traditional conformer searches. These generated conformers can then undergo further minimization or single-point calculations using MMFF94, MM3, and OPLS4 force fields.

## Outputs
The direct outputs from the ML models are provided in `.pkl` files. Scripts located in this directory are utilized to process the output data from the ML models for additional computational tasks.

## Data and Scripts

1. `ConfVAE_Diamondoutput.pkl`  
   Raw data from the ConfVAE model, trained with Diamond Energy Projects' dataset, generating structures for test molecules.

2. `ConfVAE_MMFF94.py`  
   A script to process `.pkl` structures generated by the ConfVAE model, using RDKit's MMFF94 force field for minimization.

3. `ConfVAE_MMFF94_read.py`  
   This script reads MMFF94 calculation results, including the lowest energy values and the number of conformers within a 3 to 5 kcal/mol range from the lowest energy, saving the results as a `.csv` file.

4. `ConfVAE_prepare4mini.py`  
   Prepares ConfVAE output from `.pkl` files into `.sdf` files, which are compatible with the MacroModel suite for subsequent calculations.

5. `ConfVAE_MacroModel.py`  
   Script to minimize structures generated by the ConfVAE model and perform frequency analysis using OPLS4 or MM3 force fields in the MacroModel package.

6. `Read_ConfVAEOPLS4_MM3.py`  
   Reads OPLS4 and MM3 calculation results, including the lowest energy values and conformer counts within a 3 to 5 kcal/mol range from the lowest energy for all test molecules, and saves them as a `.csv` file.

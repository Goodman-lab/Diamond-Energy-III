# Machine Learning Accelerated Diamond Energy Conformer Search Project - Results Summary

## Overview
This directory contains a summary of the results from the Machine Learning Accelerated Diamond Energy Conformer Search Project.

## Contents
The summary includes:

- The lowest energy values found by different pipelines.
- The number of low-energy conformers within 3 and 5 kcal/mol of the lowest energy value, identified by different pipelines.
- The comparison of the distance distribution of torsional angles across all conformers generated by different pipelines with the true torsional angle distribution from Diamond Energy Project's dataset.

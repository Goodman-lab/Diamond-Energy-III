# Diamond Energy Projects - Machine Learning Model Outputs

## Introduction
After learning from Diamond Energy Projectsâ€™ data, the ML models can generate low-energy conformers for test molecules. This allows us to compare their performance with that of traditional conformer search methods. The ML-generated conformers are subject to further minimization or single-point calculations using force fields such as MMFF94, MM3, and OPLS4.

## Contents
The outputs from the ML models are stored in `.pkl` files. Scripts in this directory are used to prepare the ML model output data for further calculation tasks.

## Scripts

5. `Postprocessing_CGCFMMFF94.py`  
   Reads `.pkl` structures from the CGCF model and minimizes them using RDKit's MMFF94 force field.

6. `Readresults_CGCFMMFF94.py`  
   Reads MMFF94 calculation results and saves the lowest energy values and the number of conformers within 3 and 5 kcal/mol of the lowest energy for all test molecules into a `.csv` file.

7. `CGCF_prepare4mini.py`  
   Prepares CGCF output from `.pkl` files into `.sdf` format for further calculation with the MacroModel suite.

8. `Postprocessing_CGCFOPLS4_MM3.py`  
   Minimizes structures generated by the CGCF model and conducts frequency analysis using OPLS4 or MM3 force fields in the MacroModel package.

9. `Readresults_CGCFOPLS4_MM3.py`  
   Reads OPLS4 and MM3 calculation results, including the lowest energy values and the number of conformers within 3 and 5 kcal/mol of the lowest energy for all test molecules, and saves them into a `.csv` file.

10. `sdftomae.sh`
   File format converting script.

## Machine Learning Accelerated Diamond Energy Conformer Search Project

In previous studies, it was discovered that local minima with structures resembling diamond lattices can significantly expedite the conformer search process. This project aims to utilize low-energy conformers obtained from earlier research. Specifically, we will:
1. Investigate whether current leading ML-based conformer search algorithms can rapidly learn these diamond lattice-like low-energy conformer spaces.
2. Test whether well-trained models, based on these low-energy spaces, can effectively guide a quick conformer search.

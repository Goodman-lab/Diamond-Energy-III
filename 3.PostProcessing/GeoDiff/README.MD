# GeoDiff Model Output and Scripts

## Overview
This directory contains the results directly outputted from Machine Learning (ML) models in `.pkl` file format. The included scripts are utilized to further process these ML outputs for subsequent energy calculation tasks.

## Contents

1. `GeoDiffsamplesall.pkl`  
   This file contains the raw data of the test molecules generated from the GeoDiff model. Please access through this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPwl0P6ZbE8FET7fYBTNtNo_QH_Z-ZF9/view?usp=drive_link)

2. `GeoDiff_MMFF94.py`  
   A script that processes `.pkl` structures generated by the GeoDiff model, calculating single-point energies using the MMFF94 force field. It then saves the calculation results, including single-point energy values, into a `.csv` file within the current directory.

3. `GeoDiff_MacroModel.py`  
   This script calculates the single-point energy values for structures generated by the GeoDiff model using OPLS4 and MM3 force fields within the MacroModel suite.

4. `Read_GeoDiffOPLS4_MM3.py`  
   A script that reads calculation results from OPLS4 and MM3 force fields, including single-point energy values, and saves the results into a `.csv` file in the current directory.

# Diamond Energy Projects - Machine Learning Models for Conformer Generation

## Overview
This repository contains data and scripts related to the application of Machine Learning (ML) models for generating low-energy conformers from Diamond Energy Projects' dataset. These ML models are trained with Diamond Energy low energy output to identify conformers that are likely to have lower energy and akin to a diamond lattice.

## Model Outputs
The conformers generated by the ML models undergo further minimization or single-point energy calculations using various force fields such as MMFF94, MM3, and OPLS4. The raw results of these ML models are available directly within this directory for review.

## Scripts
Included in this directory are scripts that prepare the output data from the ML models for subsequent computational tasks.

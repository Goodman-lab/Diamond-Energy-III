# ConfGF Model Output and Analysis

## Overview
The results from the ConfGF model are directly shared in `.pkl` files. The scripts provided in this directory are used to prepare the model's output data for further calculation tasks.

## Contents

1. `ConfGF_tar.gz`  
   Raw data generated from the ConfGF model. Please access through this link: [xxx](#)

2. `ConfGF_MMFF94.py`  
   Script to process `.pkl` structures generated by the ConfGF model and calculate single point energy using the RDKit function with MMFF94 force field. The results are saved in a `.csv` file within the running directory.

3. `ConfGF_MacroModel.py`  
   Script for calculating the single point energy of structures produced by the ConfGF model, utilizing OPLS4 or MM3 force fields in the MacroModel package.

4. `Read_ConfGFOPLS4MM3.py`  
   Script to read calculation results from OPLS4 and MM3 force fields and save the outcomes in a `.csv` file in the running directory.
